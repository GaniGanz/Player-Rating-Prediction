# Project Database Report
## Overview
This project aims to address the challenges associated with predicting player performance in soccer based on various metrics. 
By analyzing extensive datasets and applying machine learning techniques, we seek to provide insights into player evaluations and performance forecasting. 
The findings from this project are essential for coaches, analysts, and teams looking to enhance their decision-making processes regarding player acquisitions and game strategies.

## Dataset
The dataset utilized in this project consists of comprehensive performance statistics from various soccer leagues. 
It includes player attributes, historical performance data, and game outcomes, enabling a thorough analysis of the factors influencing player performance. 
The data has been meticulously preprocessed to ensure accuracy and relevance.

## Models Evaluated
We employed several machine learning models to predict player performance, including:

- Gradient Boosting Regressor
- Random Forest Regressor
- Linear Regression
Each model was evaluated based on metrics such as RMSE (Root Mean Square Error), MAE (Mean Absolute Error), RÂ², and MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error) 
to determine the most effective approach for this predictive analysis.

## Methodology
The project followed a structured methodology that included:

- Data Understanding: Analyzing the dataset to identify key features and relationships.
- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming the data to prepare it for modeling.
- Model Training: Implementing the selected machine learning models on the processed data.
- Model Evaluation: Assessing the models' performance using the aforementioned metrics to select the best-performing model.
## Results
The final results demonstrate the effectiveness of the Gradient Boosting Regressor, which consistently outperformed the other models across all evaluation metrics. 
This model provides a robust framework for predicting player performance, offering valuable insights that can assist teams in their strategic decisions.
